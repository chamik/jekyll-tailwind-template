# Jekyll + Tailwind template
A basic Jekyll site template using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS

## Setup

You will obvisouly need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) installed.

1. Click the green `Use this template` button at the top of this page and wait for Github to do its thing
2. Clone your new initialized repo
3. Run `npm run setup` in the repository root. This will download all of the needed dependencies.
4. You're done!

## Development

To **start the live server** run:
```sh
$ npm start
```

Once you're happy with your site, terminate your live server and run:
```sh
$ npm run build
```

The output will be in the `build/` directory.

Happy coding!
